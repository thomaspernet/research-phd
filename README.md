# Chapter 1: Structural Transformation and Foreign Direct Investment

## What do we know about Structural transformation and FDI?

  - China attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) more than any other developping countries
    - the literature mentions the agglomeration effect to explain multinational activities abroad
    - Market Structure
  - Meanwhile, China shifted its production of goods formerly produced by low-income countries to those comparable in rich countries (McMillan et al. 2014)
    - The litterature explained product upgrading through the transfer of resources from low productivity into activities with high productivity

  - The value added of this paper is to link both literature: FDI and Structural transformation

## Product Upgrading

  - Definition of product upgrading: the ability of a country to build and diversify its stock of ‘*capabilities*’ to produce complex goods.

## Why is it interesting?

### 4 contributions to the literature

  - The litterature on Structural Transformation investigates the impact on economic growth and on export growth

    - Poncet and Waldemar (2013) found that Chinese cities specializing in complex goods geared towards high productivity have a larger level of growth

  - Extend current model of location choice with a new indicator of capabilities

    - Location choice model : decision to invest at the firm level in a large number of possible region
    - Use of city-industry specific index to capture the structural transformation
      - Product upgrading is captured by a new indicator that empirically reveals the level of knowledge through the theory of capabilities

  - Provide response to empirical difficulties to measure local economic environment

    - Data on local economic environment covers a finer level of disaggregation both in term of geography of investment and sector of activities
    - Role of capabilities is specific to sector and city
    - The endogeneity problem has been addressed by including similar control variables in the literature and fixed effects in the baseline equation.

  - Role of processing trade

    - Processing trade is one of the most popular trade policies in China that aims to import tariff-free intermediate goods with high technological content while exporting goods to be sold to third-party countries
    - This policy intends to promote product quality upgrading through domestic firms’ progressive research and technology transfer.
      - technology transfer does not take place for firms operating in the processing trade
      - confine FDI and assembly activities in areas dedicated for this purpose, leading to a disconnection between the domestic producer and the foreign firm.
    - these are the ‘upstream-downstream’ links (purchase of intermediate input from a foreign firm and sale of the processed product to a domestic buyer) which generate technology transfer

## Findings

- Role of productive structure on FDI inflow

    - Region that have succeeded to build sophisticated industries enjoy larger amount of FDI
    - Complexity is stable at .29, significant at 1 percent across all column 
    - Agglomeration effect are found positive, very significant and same order of magnitude as in the literature
    - Firms have strong incentive to invest in city with favorable industrial policy

- Valuable for the policy maker

  - Target processing trade sector has no effect on FDI
  - Target innovative sectors is fundamental to bring more FDI

# Economic Openness, Industrial Policies and Quality Upgrading: Evidence from China

## What is it about?

  - Achieving economic development requires a change in the industrial structure. 
    - Countries must begin to reallocate resources to products with more **significant potential** and intrinsic features that do not restrict the capacity to innovate
    - Need of diversification
  - The government must guide the transformation by opting for industrial policies that promote continuous product upgrading
  - The determinants of structural transformation and quality upgrading through an original inudstrial policy: The Chinese VAT rebate system

## What do we know about Export and Quality

### Quality and firm performance

    - Firms exporting high-quality (price) products have high revenue, access a large number of destination markets and pay high wages

### Quality and Tariff

    - Following a trade liberalization, firm purchase higher quality input to enter more profitable market
    - Improve quality to escape competition

## What do we know about Industrial policy

  - Good policy foster export: VAT rebate is a tool to keep export value high

- Value added

  - Link both literature to find the mechanism through which quality upgrading operate

## VAT tax in China

### Main Objectives

  - VAT rebate policy, initiated by the State administration of Taxation, is designed to achieve 2 main objectives.

    - Reallocation to reduce trade dispute
    - Promote high quality products such as aviation and medical product and reduce export of polluting activities.

  - The Chinese export VAT refund mechanism in practice does not allow full recovery of the input VAT incurred for raw materials or components imported or purchased locally

    - There are 5 ranks from 5% to 17% and Chinese government frequently changes the rate according to the goals pursued

### Eligibility rule for VAT rebate

  - processing trade with supplied materials are disqualified from the rebates.
  - The typical export VAT policy is that of “exempt, credit, and refund” (or “refund after collection”)
  - the “no collection and no refund” policy applies to processing trade with supplied inputs.
  - Even if the exporter pays VAT on local purchases, there is no entitlement to any export refund.
  - Expect VAT rebates to only have an effect on eligible export activities (ordinary and processing trade with imported materials)

## Identification Strategy

### Difference-in-difference

  - Exploits both the variation in VAT rebate and the existence of a control group composed of processing firms with similar export characteristics as ordinary firms

    - require that for each ordinary firm there is at least one processing firm exporting the same product to the same destination in the same year.
    - analysis focuses on domestic Chinese ordinary and processing firms by excluding foreign-owned companies.

### Include several fixed effect

    - for sectorial, destination (origin) and location time-varying shocks which may affect firms' prices.
    - Some unobservable shocks (e.g.,specific policies at the sectorial–regional level).=> control group of processing firms => affect prices of ordinary and processing firms similarly.

### Endogeneity

  - potential endogeneity between tariff changes and the quality of firms.

    - firms' processing status is exogenous to the level of VAT rebate
    - control group is similar to our treated group in terms of ownership and export patterns by
      - (i) excluding foreign-owned companies
      - (ii) requiring that, for each ordinary firm, there is at least one processing firm exporting the same HS6 product to the same destination in the same year



# Trade And Pollution

### Facts

### Pollution in China

  - China is a first class player in the world economy for the trade, growth, technology but China is also notorious for being a major polluter.
    From [Pollution and Structural Transformation | Data Science](https://thomaspernet.netlify.com/research/structural-transformation/)

  - There is no other country in the world with a sharp increase as China.

### Trade in China

  - China rapidly grow into the factory of the World, exporting goods and manuctured products everywhere in the world.

  - In 2005, the Chinese economy dethroned the US in the merchandised exported. Since then, China never stopped to increase the gap with the other economies

### Trade and Pollution

  - A closer look between the emission of SO3 and the merchandirse exported by China despicted a clear positive correlation.

  - The pollution in China is driven by the amount of merchandise exported to the rest of the world

### Trade type, Quality and SO3

  - The chinese economy is stressing an export-oriented growth model, with a predominance for processing activities.

  - This economic system were relevant at the begining of the development stage but quickly reaches its limit.

  - The leaders of China are fully aware that significant progress has to be achieved in the need for quality growth

  - Xi Jinping launched a series of reforms to improve the lack of coordination and a more inclusive, green, innovation-driven growth and pollution free industries.

  - In this paper, we propose to establish a link between the quality enhancement of the Chinese economy and its impact on the environment.

## What is the paper about?

  - The objective of the current paper is to show, ordinary trade is beneficial for the environment

    - Does structural transformation has a positive impact on the environment?

  - Adjustment mechanism

    - output quality depends on input quality and also implies a fixed cost for quality adjustment. Assume that producing high-quality outputs requires high-quality inputs.
    - quality increase with an increase in fixed quality investment: effectiveness of RD

  - Explain the decrease in average pollution level

    - The average level of pollution decreases because of:

    - Productivity effect:

      Upgrade quality through better intermediate input and better production structure. two types of fixed cost:

      - quality upgrading in the environmental sector
      - Export
      - Firms that export quality upgraded have higher productivity, ability to move toward cleaner industry, import better quality input

    - Reallocation effect:

      low productive firms in ordinary trade have two options:

      - Self-section in the export market firms that can't pay the fixed cost to export the upgraded environmental quality products have two possibilities:
        - reallocate to processing than lower pollution
      - reallocate to ordinary polluting activity?
        - reallocate to ordinary then constant or increase pollution

  - *Proposition 1*. An increase of the quality of the ordinary firms induces a reduction in the pollution level

  - *Proposition 2*: The least productive firm in ordinary activity leave the market or switch to processing activity (less polluting) inducing a reduction in the pollution level

## Why is it interesting?

  - Chinese Trade: switch from low quality to middle-high quality
  - Chinese type of trade: Lower processing trade. Increase ordinary trade
  - Increase quality leads to more revenue and more growth.
    - But, Sandra's paper shows ordinary trade does not improve the environment, then a negative impact on growth.
    - The effect is ambiguous.
  - Add the quality into the model to explore the relationship between structural transformation, and the environment.
  - The theoretical model shows an ambiguous effect in the firm selection: average ordinary us processing what effect prevail?
  - Interesting for the policymaker because: give incentives to move away from processing AND want to fight pollution.
    - This paper can provide both theoretical and empirical explanation

## Methodology

  - Level of analysis: city, industry and year.
  - pollution = quality + quality x status.
  - use the SO2 emission to compute the level of pollution at the industry level:
    - Environmentally extended input-output of China.
    - quality is computed using price index and “Khandelwal index.
